# Eyes_Movement_Exercise

how to run code: 
1. go to the starting page of the repository 
2. click "Code" 
3. select "Download ZIP"
4. right click ZIP file and choose to extract the ZIP (name of option may vary depending on software used to extract)
5. open the "Index.html" file with your browser (tested with google chrome, if it doesn't work with your default, try using chrome)

possible future improvements: 
1. code for the eyes to follow your cursor individually
2. option to switch between the two modes (eyes follow individually, eys follow together)
3. ability to rebind the "center" for your cursor (in terms of where the eyes follow)
